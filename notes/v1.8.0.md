# Changelog

This release of the Elastic Cloud SDK Go should be used for ECE Version `3.0.0`.

## Enhancements

### Add insecure attribute on cluster meta ([#367](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/367))

Cluster Metadata Info did not have any attributes to imply whether cert verification should be skipped when trying to communicate with it.
### Update swagger generated code to MS68 release (removal of deployment template endpoints) ([#374](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/374))

This PR updates the API with changes from ms-68 (still not removing the clusters API) but it does remove the old deployment templates endpoint and models.

### Update swagger generated code to MS68 release (removal of clusters API) ([#375](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/375))

This PR updates the API with changes from ms-68 (removing the clusters API and the reauthenticate endpoint)

### Add 409 response to Mock API client ([#377](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/377))

It adds HTTP 409 response to Mock API client. To be able to run acceptance tests in TF ElasticCloud provider, we need to mock API client and e.g. to check whether a role already exists, we need to return that HTTP code.

### Re-generate code based on ms-69's apidocs.json ([#379](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/379))

This PR updates apidocs.json file along with its regenerated derivatives to match the upcoming release.

## Bug fixes

### Avoid escaping JSON string payload for set-deployment-resource-raw-metadata ([#369](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/369))

When leveraging the cloud client method for: https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/deployments/deployments_client.go#L1552-L1586 which hits the following API endpoint: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-enterprise/current/set-deployment-resource-raw-metadata.html, we should not be escaping the string JSON body.

### Add API validation in CreateKey ([#378](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/378))

Adds the missing api.API validation in CreateKeyParams.Validate().
