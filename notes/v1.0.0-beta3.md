## Notable changes
<!-- Add the list of notable changes, remove otherwise.-->
### Add DecodeFlags to reduce parsing code

Adds a new DecodeFlags function which through reflection and
mapstructure is able to decode a cobra.Command defined flags into a
structure's fields which match the flag's type and mapstructure tag.

### Add package with Prefixed error type

Adds a new package under pkg/multierror which is aimed to be used
instead of multierror.Error. The main motivation behind this change is
to enforce a prefix to be used in all of the multierrors which will
provide more context to the error consumers.

### Modify transport to handle proxied responses

Modifies the ErrCatchTransport type so that it handles the case when
Content-Type is text/html, the auto-generated client framework won't
be able to handle the proxied responses of that type since they're
contingent on the error response specified by the swagger definition,
thus anything with a Content-Type different than application/json
won't be handled and instead a cryptic error will be returned.

### Add change tracker backed by Deployments API

New TrackChange function which uses the deployments
API to track any pending changes of a Deployment. It supports tracking
changes by specifying a DeploymentID or ResourceID and Kind which
is very similar to what the legacy plan tracker did.
