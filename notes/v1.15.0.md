# Changelog

This release of the Elastic Cloud SDK Go should be used for ECE Version `3.7.0`.

## Enhancements

### Update API spec to ESS MS-101 ([#451](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/451))

Updates the generated clients and models to match the API available in Elastic cloud MS-101.

## Bug fixes

### Handle empty `instance_configuration_version`s in topology elements. ([#450](https://github.com/elastic/cloud-sdk-go/issues/450))

We couldn't set `instance_configuration_version` to 0 because it would be considered as an empty value and it would be omitted during JSON marshalling.
This has now been fixed by updating the `instance_configuration_version` type to `*int32`.
