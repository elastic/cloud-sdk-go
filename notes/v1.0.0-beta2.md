# Changelog

## Notable changes
<!-- Add the list of notable changes, remove otherwise.-->
This is a slim release on the SDK side, mainly contains bug fixes, version updates development improvements.
As usual, the autogenerated Go code has been updated to match the 2.5.0 ECE API swagger specification.

### Features

#### Customizable User-Agent

Allows the user to configure a user agent via `api.Config.UserAgent`. If the field is not set, it defaults
to `cloud-sdk-go/<version>`, which after this release will be `cloud-sdk-go/2.5.0`.

### Bug fixes
<!-- Add the list of bug fixes, remove otherwise.-->

#### Plan tracker reported some plans as successfully finished when they actually failed

Fixes a bug in the plan tracker logic which made it return the first
step which finished with status "error" rather than the last step. This
has many downstream effects but more notably, makes vacates miss the end
result of the vacate and potentially set a cluster vacate as "Sucessful"
when it is not.
