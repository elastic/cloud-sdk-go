title: Handle empty `instance_configuration_version`s in topology elements.
description: |
  We couldn't set `instance_configuration_version` to 0 because it would be considered as an empty value and it would be omitted during JSON marshalling.
  This has now been fixed by updating the `instance_configuration_version` type to `*int32`.
