title: Add failure fields to plan tracking
description: |
    A new `FailureDetails` field has been added to the plan tracking output and returned error from `plan.TrackChange`.

    This change will only be noticeable for clients that chose to plan a change with a JSON formatter. Other clients
    outputs will remain untouched.
