# Changelog

This release of the Elastic Cloud SDK Go should be used for ECE Version ``.

## New APIs

### Add new `trafficfilterapi.NewUpdateRequestFromGet` ([#317](https://something/issues/317))

New function allows building a traffic filter update request from the current traffic filter.

## Enhancements

### Add failure fields to plan tracking ([#315](https://something/issues/315))

A new `FailureDetails` field has been added to the plan tracking output and returned error from `plan.TrackChange`.

This change will only be noticeable for clients that chose to plan a change with a JSON formatter. Other clients
outputs will remain untouched.

## Bug fixes

### Fix ignored "order" field in `DeploymentTemplate` structures ([#323](https://something/issues/323))

Updates the field type of the `DeploymentTemplate` structures to `*int32` so the `0` value is not lost when the JSON is decoded.
