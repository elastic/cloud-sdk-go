package api

// Version contains the ECE API version compatibility for the current
// auto-generated client and models. This needs to be updated every time a new
// `api/apidocs.json` file added and the client and models are re-generated.
// Even though the Bugfix version is specified, the general support statement is
// on the minor version, i.e: 2.4.2 means that all the 2.4 branch is supported,
// expecting some potentially unfixed bugs when ECE version is the same feature
// version bug higher bugfix version.
const Version = "2.4.2"
